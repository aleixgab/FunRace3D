# FunRace3D
 

Fun Race 3D is a copy of the game created by [Good Job Games](https://www.goodjobgames.com). I made this game in less than 5hours. Otherwise, I may continue creating more content in a few months.

I wanted to use [BG Curves](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/bg-curve-59043) that I had practised last year. However, I used [BÃ©zier Path Creator](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/b-zier-path-creator-136082) because I had some problems with that. It takes me extra time that I didn't expect, I thought that I knew how to do it well but with the other one is more manageable, I just had to learn how it works correctly.

I think the camera is one fundamental element in one game like this. It helps a lot all the user experience. I change the camera only once I would like to do more movements. Moreover, I could do the obstacles more enjoyable and a deeper level.

What I want to improve it's the AI. The other player should be more intelligent, having some sensor and generating a simple behaviour tree or one FMS. Moreover, creating more levels and longer with different obstacles. Once we already have the base is not difficult to create more levels and obstacles.
Furthermore, some jumps, toboggans, stair or something to change the focus axis to get it more interesting.

Thank you for reading this.
